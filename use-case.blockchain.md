# Blockchain analysis

1. Transaction Visualization: Cosmograph can represent blockchain addresses as nodes and their connections as edges. This visualization allows users to understand the overall structure and patterns of transactions in the blockchain network.
2. Address Clustering: Cosmograph can analyze the transaction data to identify clusters of addresses that are likely controlled by the same entity or user. By visually grouping addresses that frequently transact with each other, Cosmograph can help identify potential clusters representing individual users, exchanges, or services.
3. Anomaly Detection: By visualizing the transaction graph, Cosmograph can help identify anomalous patterns or outliers. Sudden spikes in transaction volume, unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated addresses, or patterns indicating potential money laundering or fraud can be visually analyzed using Cosmograph.
4. Integration with External Data: Cosmograph can incorporate external data sources to enhance the analysis of blockchain transactions. For example, it can integrate with identity verification services, allowing users to link addresses to real-world entities and perform more accurate analysis and attribution.
